# About Sentimental-Analysis: Tesla Upcoming Cybertruck Project

The unicorn product of Tesla, Cybertruck, is without doubt one of the most eccentric-designed, versatile one among its own kind. However, there is not a small number of people find its design to be unaesthetic, and come with unneccessary additions. This sentiment-analysis is aiming to find out how welcoming the public are to the Cybertruck, and what kinds of criticisms are the most popular right now. So that, we could assess the impact the Cybertruck will make on the industry, and how much revenue will it generate for the company.

## Collaborating 

-In order for this project to success, not only data analysis process has to be precise and efficient, we will also need in-depth knowledge on the truck market. So what can collaborators do to contribute to this project ?

1. Read and aggregate articles on Cybertruckï¼šPut it in 1 file what you consider most impactful point to the analysis.
2. Find out valuable resouces that are not limited to data type.

## Analysis Conducting Procedure

### 1. Data Collecting 

-This maybe the most cumbersome part of this projects as many questions need to answered in order to have proper, high-influential datasets such as:

+ What kind of data will help us understand the current sentiment toward Cybertruck ? - Tweets, Facebook Posts, Reddit posts... these are for sentiment analysis, we want to go a step further to take data from Tesla on the number of pre-ordered truck, and how its market will affect the sales.
+ Where will we get the data from ? Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Tesla.
+ How will we get it ? Through access to APIs of those SMS, and scraping Tesla website data.

### 2. Data Wrangling
- This part includes cleaning, standardizing and feature engineering (if neccessary): Currently being carried out
### 3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Performing multiple visualizations and deduce a substantial story from it.
### 4. Preparing data for training
- This part should be the same as step 2, but since its original, we need to label manually, or finding out pre-trained model to label the data before train: Currently being carried out.
### 5. Modelling
-  We are trying out Logistic Regression using sklearn and numpy: Currently being carried out
### 6. The Result
- Expected result is to show different sentiment toward diffent aspects of the Cybertruck. Thus estimate which one should be made changes to.
